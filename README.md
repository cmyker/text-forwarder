# Text Forwarder (TW)

A minimal Android utility that appears in the text selection menu as "TW".

## What it does

This app provides a quick shortcut to forward selected text to a specific application. It's particularly useful for sending text to apps that don't appear in the standard "Share" menu or are buried deep in the list (e.g., a dictionary or translation app).

## How it works

1.  **Select text** in any app that supports text selection.
2.  Tap the **⋮** menu and choose **TFW**.
3.  The first time you use it, you'll see a list of apps that can receive text.
4.  Choose an app from the list. If you check the "Remember choice" box, that app will become your default target.
5.  The selected text will be sent to the chosen app.
6.  The next time you use TFW, it will directly send the text to your remembered app.

## Settings

The main app screen allows you to see the currently selected target app and clear it if you want to choose a different one on the next use.
